#Importing text files line by line
#For large file, we may want to print only the first few lines. So, use readline() method
# When a file called 'file' (or any other name we want) is open, you can print out the first line by executing file.readline() [i.e. filename.readline()]
#If you execute the same command again, the second line will print, and so on.
# Use together with context manager i.e. we bind a variable file by using a context manager construct:
##with open('huck_finn.txt') as file:
#While still within this construct, the variable file will be bound to open('huck_finn.txt'); thus, to print the file to the shell, all the code you need to execute is:
## with open('huck_finn.txt') as file:
## print(file.readline())

# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
